# Python work
This is a collection of all my projects, scripts and notes as I continue to learn Python (and C# next).

- **Check out [WeatherGet.py](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/tree/master/Python/Projects/WeatherGet)!**
- *For current projects and larger scripts, check [Python/Projects](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/tree/master/Python/Projects).*
- *For smaller scripts and automation, check [Python/Scripts/Automation](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/tree/master/Python/Scripts/Automation).*
