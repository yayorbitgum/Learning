# Personal Projects
This is a collection of all my [active projects](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/tree/master/Python/Projects), standalone [scripts](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/tree/master/Python/Scripts/Automation) and notes as I continue to learn more about Python and C#.

- **Check out [WeatherGet](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/tree/master/Python/Projects/WeatherGet) for a console-based short-term weather forecast. Involves building things with API calls, using fuzzy matching for correcting user input, and using a live UI method within the console.**
