# Personal Projects
This is a collection of all my [active projects](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/tree/master/Python/Projects), standalone [scripts](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/tree/master/Python/Scripts/Automation) and notes as I continue to learn Python (with C# and C++ next).

- **Check out [WeatherGet](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/tree/master/Python/Projects/WeatherGet) for building things with API calls and using fuzzy matching for correcting user input.**
- **Check out [Shingeki Scraper](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/blob/master/Python/Projects/ShingekiScraper/shingeki.py) for scraping a site to grab all "Attack on Titan" manga pages and structuring them locally for on-demand backup.**
- *For current projects and larger scripts, check [Python/Projects](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/tree/master/Python/Projects).*
- *For smaller scripts and automation, check [Python/Scripts/Automation](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/tree/master/Python/Scripts/Automation).*
