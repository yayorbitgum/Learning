# Python work
This is a collection of all my projects, scripts and notes as I continue to learn Python (and C# next).

- Check out WeatherGet.py in Python/Projects/WeatherGet!
- For current projects and larger scripts, check Python/Projects.
- For smaller scripts and automation, check Python/Scripts/Automation.
