# Learning Everything In Python
This is going to be a collection of all my various projects and files I make and notate as I continue to learn Python, starting with Crash Course and Automate the Boring Stuff books.

I'll also be adding any little project I make along the way. As time goes on I'll make an effort to keep things organized and clean. Eventually with more complex projects, I'll split them out into their own repositories with libraries and packages attached. 

For now, the first real attempt at a project is the ISS Tracker project.
