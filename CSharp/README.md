# FlashingLights
Scripts for a Unity project. 
While this particular project isn't going to become a game, it is a staging area for me exploring neat logic to be used later in an actual game. 
You can poke around the scripts here if you'd like.

Example of FlashingLights.cs and RandomRoadElevations.cs (The road wobbles violently the farther away from each piece you are, and flattens as you approach).
