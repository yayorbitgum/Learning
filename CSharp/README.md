# FlashingLights
Scripts for a Unity project. 
While this particular project isn't going to become a game, it is a staging area for me exploring neat logic to be used later in an actual game. 
You can poke around the scripts here if you'd like.

Example of [FlashingLights.cs](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/blob/master/CSharp/FlashingLights/FlashingLights.cs) and [RandomRoadElevations.cs](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/Personal/blob/master/CSharp/FlashingLights/RandomRoadElevations.cs) (The road wobbles violently the farther away from each piece you are, and flattens as you approach).
