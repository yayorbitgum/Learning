This is where I'm placing my data files locally, ie 
  - NationalFile_20200501.txt containing all US-based geographical data, or
  - Countries_populatedplaces_p.txt containing all geographical data of populated locations on the entire planet, 
but they're way too large to upload to github, hahah.

In the future for a real application, I'd need to host these on a server and make requests.
But for my own personal use, let's just use my perfectly free-to-access local SSD.
